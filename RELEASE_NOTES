	base-R3-14-9-lcls1

streamdevice-R2-3-lcls7: Build against asyn-R4-9-lcls1 and

	would build for both architectures but would not boot in RTEMS.
	Also eliminate dependencies on CALC and SSCAN as they are not needed.
	Build against base-R3-14-8-2-lcls2.

streamdevice-R2-3-lcls2: New streamdevice version 2.3.  Includes support
	for regular expressions.  Built against base 3.14.8.2

streamdevice-R2-3-lcls1: New streamdevice version 2.3.  Includes support
	for regular expressions.

streamdevice-R2-2-lcls3: Same streamdevice as previous version.  Built
	against base-R3-14-9-lcls1 and asyn-R4-7-1-lcls3

streamdevice-R2-2-lcls2: Same streamdevice as previous version.  Built
	against base-R3-14-8-2-lcls2 and asyn-R4-7-1-lcls2

	patches applied: 20070803, 20070808, 20070814, 20070824, 20070827.
	This module depends on asyn only.  (The previous version required
	calc and sscan.)

streamdevice-R2-1-patch200606213-LCLS-1: Initial release used in LCLS 
	Injector and BC1.  No code changes from modules/streamdevice/Devl 
	version or former epics/site version.  Source is 
	StreamDevice-2-1-patch200606213 from the Swiss Light Source.  This 
	module depends on the following modules: calc-R2-6-1-LCLS-1,
