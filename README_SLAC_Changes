The SLAC internal changes for Stream Device were made in order to provide a message engine thread that controls when a message should be print to the IOC console. The goal is to reduce the number of messages that are output to not flood the log system.

To activate the message engine, issue the IOC console command streamMessageTimeout with the number of seconds that the engine should hold before printing a message. For example, after a 5 seconds timeout is defined, the output will be similar to:

Stream Device: this message was received 15 times in the last 5 seconds:
2019/05/22 14:28:55.814444 scan-1 SXR:GMD:ETM:01:Reading lockRequest: pasynManager->queueRequest() failed: port S1 not connected

To deactivate the engine, pass 0 to streamMessageTimeout.
